# Climate Data- Supervised Machine Learning in Python
Analyzed climate data on 15 weather stations across Europe predicting pleasant vs. unpleasant days.

## Summary
This modeling was conducted for ClimateWins on weather station data across 15 European Cities.
The KNN supervised ML model is the most accurate and recommended in the given context.
Creating a model dictated largely by a single parameter does limit its ability to measure across various climates.

## Data
Data was from the European Climate Assessment & Dataset Project (ECA&D) collected by the European Environment Agency (EEA).
Code related to the python analysis can be found in this repository.
